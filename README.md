# NAME

Test::FITesque::RDF - Formulate Test::FITesque fixture tables in RDF

# SYNOPSIS

    my $suite = Test::FITesque::RDF->new(source => $file)->suite;
    $suite->run_tests;

See `t/integration-basic.t` for a full test script example.

# DESCRIPTION

This module enables the use of Resource Description Framework to
describe fixture tables. It will take the filename of an RDF file and
return a [Test::FITesque::Suite](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::FITesque::Suite) object that can be used to run
tests.

The RDF serves to identify the implementation of certain fixtures, and
can also supply parameters that can be used by the tests, e.g. input
parameters or expectations. See [Test::FITesque](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::FITesque) for more on how the
fixtures are implemented.

## ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS

This module implements the following attributes and methods:

- `source`

    Required attribute to the constructor. Takes a [Path::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/Path::Tiny) object
    pointing to the RDF file containing the fixture tables. The value will
    be converted into an appropriate object, so a string can also be
    supplied.

- `suite`

    Will return a [Test::FITesque::Suite](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::FITesque::Suite) object, based on the RDF data supplied to the constructor.

- `transform_rdf`

    Will return an arrayref containing tests in the structure used by
    [Test::FITesque::Test](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::FITesque::Test). Most users will rather call the `suite`
    method than to call this method directly.

- `base_uri`

    A [IRI](https://metacpan.org/pod/IRI) to use in parsing the RDF fixture tables to resolve any relative URIs.

## REQUIRED RDF

The following must exist in the test description (see below for an example and prefix expansions):

- `test:fixtures`

    The object(s) of this predicate lists the test fixtures that will run
    for this test suite. May take an RDF List. Links to the test
    descriptions, which follow below.

- `test:script`

    The object of this predicate contains the function name of the actual test script as a literal.

- `dc:description`

    The object of this predicate provides a literal description of the test.

- `test:params`

    The object of this predicate links to the paramaters, which may have many different shapes.

- `rdf:type` aka `<a`>

    The object of this predicate is the class of test, which again links
    contains the required `test:handler` predicate, whose object
    contains the class name of the implementation of the tests.

## RDF EXAMPLE

The below example starts with prefix declarations. Since this is a
pre-release, some of the prefixes are preliminary examples. Then, the
tests in the fixture table are listed explicitly. Only tests mentioned
using the `test:fixtures` predicate will be used. Tests may be an RDF
List, in which case, the tests will run in the specified sequence, if
not, no sequence may be assumed.

Then, two test fixtures are declared. The RDF class of the test
fixture is used to denote identify the Perl class containing the
implementations, through the `test:handler` predicate which is the
concrete class name. The `test:script` predicate is used to name the
function within that class.

The `test:params` predicate is used to link the parameters that will
be sent as a hashref into the function. The &lt;dc:description> predicate
is required to exist outside of the parameters, but will be included
as a parameter as well.

There are two different mechanisms for passing parameters to the test
scripts, one is simply to pass arbitrary key-value pairs, the other is
to pass lists of HTTP request-response objects.

### Key-value parameters

The key of the hashref passed as arguments will be the local part of
the predicate used in the description (i.e. the part after the colon
in e.g. `my:all`). It is up to the test writer to mint the URIs of
the parameters, and the `param_base` is used to set indicate the
namespace, so that the local part can be resolved, if wanted. The
resolution itself happens in [URI::NamespaceMap](https://metacpan.org/pod/URI::NamespaceMap).

### HTTP request-response lists

To allow testing HTTP-based interfaces, this module also allows the
construction of two ordered lists, one with HTTP requests, the other
with HTTP responses. With those, the framework will construct
[HTTP::Request](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Request) and [HTTP::Response](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Response) objects respectively. In tests
scripts, the request objects will typically be passed to the
[LWP::UserAgent](https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent) as input, and then the response from the remote
server will be compared with the expected [HTTP::Response](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Response)s made by
the test fixture.

This gets more complex, please see the test data file
`t/data/http-list.ttl` file for example.

# TODO

Separate the implementation-specific details (such as `test:handler`)
from the actual fixture tables.
